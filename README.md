# GraphQLAPIKit

Lightweight GraphQL API client based on [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios).
Developed to simplify [Futured](https://www.futured.app) in-house development of applications, that work with GraphQL APIs.

Currently there is no support for some Apollo's features:
- Apollo built-in cache
- GraphQL subscriptions
- Custom interceptors

## Installation

When using Swift package manager install or add following line to your dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/futuredapp/GraphQLAPIKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
```
